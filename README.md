Project Euler
=============

http://projecteuler.net/

These are my(*) Project Euler solutions. Everything is done in Java. I will provide results too, but you are encouraged to solve the problems yourself, or at leasy study the code.

*Since I'm new to programming and I can't solve every problem, some of the code you will find here is an exact copy of other people's work.
